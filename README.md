# nutritionPlanner

Welcome to my nutrition planner application.

The goal of this side project is to replace myfitnesspal because i dislike the 
app and want to learn more about nutrition as well as API calls and machine learning algorithms.

On startup, the user will be asked basic questions to guague what the plan should look like
The program uses the Mifflin-St Jeor Equation to determine resting metabolc rate
From this, the user is asked how active they are 1-5 to find total calories burned in a day

For goals, the user is asked whether they want to maintain weight, or lose/gain .5/1 lb a week.
